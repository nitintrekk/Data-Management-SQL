    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The global sportswear market is projected to grow 52% from 2021 until 2028 at a CAGR of 6.6% in forecast period, 2021-2028. \n",
    "The market is growing enormously, as people are progressively enticed by the product's capability to offer sweat-wicking & breathability and enhancement of physical movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rising growth of the urban population escalates  the consumption of the product due to the increasing involvement of people in fitness activities. This provides the European sports clothes company to expand their hold on this industry globally\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a supply chain across international borders is difficult. Imports, exports, shipping, and operational logistics are governed by a number of complicated international laws, trade agreements, and other legal frameworks. When exporting goods from one nation to another, you must take into account not just the environmental issues but also the time and expense involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's crucial to take your time while considering global expansion. You must create a strong supply chain plan if you want to apply improvements to your supply chain in the future. For instance, you can encounter difficulties stocking shelves as quickly as you would want if your rivals obtain their products from a nearby place.\n",
    "\n",
    "It isn't possible to create a supply chain strategy that fits all situations. Depending on where you're expanding, you need to develop them accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segmentation by product type and end user**\n",
    "\n",
    "Segmentation by product type is important for sportswear companies expanding globally because it allows them to effectively target their offerings to the specific needs and preferences of different markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cultural differences: Different countries and regions have unique cultural preferences when it comes to sportswear. For example, running shoes may be more popular in the United States, while soccer cleats may be in higher demand in Europe. By segmenting their products by type, sportswear companies can better understand the cultural differences and preferences of each market and tailor their offerings accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market demand: Different markets may have varying levels of demand for certain types of sportswear products. By segmenting their offerings by product type, companies can more easily identify which products are in higher demand in each market and adjust their product mix accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competitive landscape: Different regions may have different competitors with unique strengths and weaknesses. By segmenting their products by type, sportswear companies can more effectively differentiate themselves from their competitors by highlighting their strengths in specific product categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brand positioning: Sportswear companies often have a specific brand image or positioning that they want to convey to consumers. By segmenting their products by type, companies can more effectively position their brand and tailor their messaging to specific product categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, segmentation by product type is an important strategy for sportswear companies expanding globally because it allows them to better understand the unique needs and preferences of different markets and tailor their offerings and messaging accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ditribution Channel**\n",
    "\n",
    "Segmentation by end user is an important consideration for sportswear companies when expanding globally. This is because different regions and cultures have unique preferences and needs when it comes to sportswear, and targeting a broad market with a one-size-fits-all approach may not be effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "By segmenting the market by end user, companies can tailor their products and marketing strategies to meet the specific needs and preferences of different groups. For example, a company may focus on developing products and marketing campaigns targeted towards women in the Middle East who prefer modest clothing, or towards athletes in South America who prioritize lightweight and breathable fabrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can help companies differentiate themselves from their competitors, build stronger relationships with their customers, and ultimately increase their market share and profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, by segmenting the market, companies can identify and target specific niches that may be underserved or overlooked by their competitors. For example, a company may identify a growing market for sustainable sportswear among environmentally-conscious consumers, and develop products and marketing campaigns targeted specifically towards this group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, segmentation by end user is an important consideration for sportswear companies when expanding globally, as it can help them better understand and meet the unique needs and preferences of different groups, differentiate themselves from their competitors, and ultimately increase their market share and profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Competitive Market environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "Competitive market environment: The sportswear industry is highly competitive, and the success of a company depends on its ability to compete effectively in the global marketplace. A competitive market environment can help companies to improve their products, pricing, and marketing strategies to stay ahead of the competition. By analyzing the competitive landscape, a company can identify opportunities and threats, as well as potential competitors, and develop effective strategies to address them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distribution channels: Distribution channels are crucial in the global expansion of a sportswear company. The choice of distribution channels will depend on the target market, product type, and local regulations. A well-planned distribution strategy can help the company to reach its target market efficiently and effectively, and reduce the costs associated with logistics and warehousing. An effective distribution strategy can also help the company to establish a strong brand presence in the new market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market research: Before expanding globally, a company needs to conduct extensive market research to understand the needs, preferences, and behaviors of the target market. This research can help the company to tailor its products and marketing strategies to the local market, and identify potential distribution channels that will be most effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local partnerships: To succeed in a new market, it's essential for a sportswear company to establish local partnerships with distributors, retailers, and other businesses. These partnerships can help the company to navigate local regulations and cultural differences, and build a strong brand presence in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The following countries are recommended for expansion based on the analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Opening Retail stores in Australia:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The retails store segment is estimated to lead the market due to the rising number of popular sportswear brands across the globe, increasingly broadening the number of physical stores. Additionally, a large number of consumers possessing the desire to avoid misfits, delays in delivery and complications regarding the return and replacement would increase the usage of retail stores. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to our analysis of sales and profits, all retail stores in the eight states of Australia for categories like accessories, juniors, men, shoes, and women are highly profitable. Over 60% on an average in each of targeted category.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be wise for us to start selling our goods in these eight states so that we can get on the market. We will eventually be able to spread out into further states in this nation. Also, they have a dense population, which makes it simpler and more economical to reach more potential clients. We can thus expand into these areas in the hopes of establishing a solid clientele that will support our growth and raise our market share.\n",

    "\n",
    "North America is leading the sportswear market, exhibiting a size of 72 billion USD in 2020. The thriving growth of the recreational industry in this region resulted in escalating the utilization of the product. \n",
    "South Amerixa is also projected to display considerable growth due to the gradual decline of the unemplyement rate, surging the purchasing power of many people. \n",
    "Running a supply chain across international borders is difficult. Imports, exports, shipping, and operational logistics are governed by a number of complicated international laws, trade agreements, and other legal frameworks.\n",
    "When exporting goods from one country to another, you must take time, cost, and environmental considerations into account.\n",
    "Given the data of people from USA and Puerto Rico ordering from around the globe, setting up plants in South Asia,Africa and the Caribbean would benefit the company. The rent index is relatively low and these regions have abundant natural resources,large labour pool and low GDP."
